## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) installed or a remote MongoDB URI
- A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Change to the project's directory:

   ```bash
   cd store-api
   ```

3. Install the project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the server, use the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will start on the specified port (default is 3000). You can access the API at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser or by making HTTP requests.

### API Endpoints

- `/api/v1/products`: Endpoint for managing and retrieving product data.
  - `GET /api/v1/products`: Retrieve a list of products based on various criteria.
  - Add more details about other endpoints here.

## Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration. Make sure to create a `.env` file in the project root and configure the following variables:

- `PORT`: The port on which the server will run.
- `MONGO_URI`: The MongoDB URI for connecting to your database.

Example `.env` file:

```
PORT=3000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/store
```

## Database

The application uses MongoDB as the database. You can configure the MongoDB connection by setting the `MONGO_URI` environment variable in the `.env` file.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling middleware to handle various types of errors. Custom error handling can be found in the `middleware/error-handler.js` file.
